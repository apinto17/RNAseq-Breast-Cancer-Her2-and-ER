## Overview

This project is a midterm in an RNA-seq analysis class where I looked at the expression data between tumor and non-tumor groups, and broke the analysis down by HER2 and ER status, 
both critical markers for breast cancer management. I used data from TCGA and utitlized mRNA expression as well as corresponding protein expression data.
